                <ul><li><h2>Hassan II Mosque</h2></li></ul>
                <p>The Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca was completed in 1993 after great expense and artistic labor, and the result is one of the largest and most beautiful mosques in the world.</p>
                <p>The Hassan II Mosque is open to all Muslims at daily prayer times and for special Friday services. Non-Muslim visitors may enter the mosque on guided tours, which take place several times a day in English.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The most distinctive characteristic of the Hassan II Mosque is its spectacular location on a platform over the Atlantic Ocean. Uniquely, part of the mosque's floor is made of glass so worshippers can kneel directly over the sea. Unfortunately, this wonderful feature is mainly for royal use and is off-limits to visitors.</p>
                <p>Above, an automated sliding roof opens (on special occasions) to the heavens. Thus the faithful of Casablanca can indeed contemplate God's sky and ocean.</p>
                <p>At 689 feet, the Great Mosque's minaret is the tallest structure in Morocco and the tallest minaret in the world. At night, lasers shine a beam from the top of the minaret toward Mecca, "to point the way to God." The building was designed to withstand earthquakes and has a heated floor and electric doors.</p>

                <ul><li><h2>Casablanca Cathedral</h2></li></ul>
                <p>The huge Cathédrale Sacré-Coeur is a surprising sight in the heart of Casablanca. With its unique architecture, the disused church seems both out of place and in harmony with its surroundings all at the same time.</p>
                <p>Casablanca's cathedral was built in 1930, when Morocco was still under the rule of Catholic France. Falling into disuse after Morocco's independence in 1956, the Cathédrale Sacré-Coeur was used as a school and then a culture center. Today, it hosts fairs and exhibitions.</p>
                <p>The Sacré-Coeur Cathedral is a fascinating work of architecture. Designed by the French architect Paul Tournon, who also designed several churches in France, it represents an interesting experiment in the decorative use of cast concrete.</p>

                <ul><li><h2>Twin Center</h2></li></ul>
                <p>The Casablanca Twin Center is a complex of two skyscrapers located at Casablanca, Morocco. The two structures, the West Tower and the East Tower, have 28 floors each. The centre houses a complex of shops, offices, and a 5 star hotel, and lies at the heart of Casablanca in the Maarif district, at the crossroads between Zerktouni Boulevard and the Boulevard Al Massira Al Khadra. The main architect was the Spanish Catalan Ricardo Bofill Levi and the associate architect was the Moroccan Elie Mouyal.</p>
                <p>The complex forms the main gateway to the residential districts in the west of the city, and is located on a triangular site which emphasizes the project’s asymmetry. The two connecting towers are identical, but distinct, and are joined at the lower levels by a large complex containing the bulk of the popular shopping centre. The whole structure presents a modern high-tech image, with a pared-down design and minimal relief, while local tradition is maintained in the building materials: marble, plaster, and ceramic tiles.</p>
